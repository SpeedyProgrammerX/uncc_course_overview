## About this Course

The thing we're going to learn about in this course, **computer vision**, has a very interesting history. It's roots really go all the way back to the beginning of computing and artifical intelligence. When this course is over, I want you to understand where we really are today, how we got here, and be able to make some reasonable conjectures about where the field is going next.

I want you to be comfortable with cutting edge deep learning techniques, but also understand the broader context to which they belong. I want you to really understand why it's so deceptively difficult to program a computer to anything remotely close to what our visual cortex does.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Setup** and manage a scientific python computing environment
2. **Implement** key computer vision algorithms in python to solve real computer vision problems
3. **Train + Validate** machine learning models to find data-based solutions to computer vision problems
4. **Interpret** algorithm performance through measurement techniques and by creating clarifying visualizations
5. **Debug** issues in computer vision algorithms in python
6. **Understand** the difference between analytical and empirical techniques, and the role each plays in the field
7. **Discuss** historical and current trends in computer vision and key research developments
8. **Collaborate** with peers and advisors to find and implement solutions to real computer vision problems
